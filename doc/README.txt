yajl-js aims to be a complete binding to the http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/[yajl] JSON parser by Lloyd Hilaiel.
yajl is a SAX-style event-driven parser well suited to JavaScript programming style.


* Implement public API bindings
* Make it more object-oriented compared to the C version
* Provide some higher level wraps around things like onStartArray/Map so that applications can instead
  hook onto onArray or onMap
