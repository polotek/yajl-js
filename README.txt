yajl-js aims to be a complete binding to the Yajl (http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/) JSON parser by Lloyd Hilaiel.
yajl is a SAX-style event-driven parser well suited to JavaScript programming style.

== Current Status
* Parser bindings [done]
* Generator bindings [left]
* Provide some higher level wraps around things like onStartArray/Map so that applications can instead
  hook onto onArray or onMap [ not sure if required ]
